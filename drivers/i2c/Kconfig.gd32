	  This can significantly improve performance for large transfers
	  by offloading data movement from the CPU to the DMA controller.

	  Minimum transfer size (in bytes) to use DMA instead of PIO mode.
	  Transfers smaller than this threshold will use PIO mode.
	  Larger values reduce DMA setup overhead for small transfers.
	  Default of 16 bytes provides good balance for most applications.

	  Timeout in milliseconds for DMA transfers.
	  If a DMA transfer does not complete within this time,
	  it will be considered failed.
